We want to recognise and identify in real-time paintings in a museum. This can be viewed as a beginning of a guide for a museum. We also want the program to be interactive in the following way: if the user points his index finger at a painting, we aim to detect the painting he's pointing at so that the Glass displays information upon what the user wants. Secondly, we want to recognise a few monuments in the street and retrieve the point of view and the position of the user looking at them. All algorithms must be implemented on Android and must be time and space efficient enough to be run on Google Glass. C++ and openCV will be used.
